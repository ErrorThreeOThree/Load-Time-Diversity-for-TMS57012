This projects is used to verify the variant creation algorithm used in the load_time_diversity project.

To set a different user application, change the function `init_div_data()` and `init_code()` in the `diversification.c` file. The default values are 100 MISs containing one branch instruction to each MIS to verify all possible branch_table entries. The algorithm was later used in the load_time_diversity project.
